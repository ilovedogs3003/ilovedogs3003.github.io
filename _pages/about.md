Coming from a small, rural town in Colombia, I deeply understand the impact education can have on the trajectory of one's life. Motivated by my lived experience and a desire to change the world for the better, I am passionate about addressing disparities in our education system by **bridging the gap between research and practice**. 

Through empirical methods, advocacy, and public policy, I am to make a world where childen don't have to consider themselves lucky to have earned a high school or college education.
